<span class="dropcap">I</span>t has been almost a year since my last Scala tutorial here.

That's mainly because I've started writing for [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/) as well, and time has been short.
If you are interested, look at my [latest writings](https://pedrorijo.com/external/#baeldung):

* [Iteration With Index and Value in Scala](https://www.baeldung.com/scala/iteration-index-value)
* [Joining a Collection of Strings in Scala](https://www.baeldung.com/scala/join-string-collection)
* [Repeated Parameters in Scala](https://www.baeldung.com/scala/repeated-parameters)
* [Finding the Index of an Element in a List with Scala](https://www.baeldung.com/scala/find-index-element-in-list)
* [How to Read Environment Variables in Scala](https://www.baeldung.com/scala/environment-variables)
* [Conversion to and from a String in Scala](https://www.baeldung.com/scala/convert-to-from-string)

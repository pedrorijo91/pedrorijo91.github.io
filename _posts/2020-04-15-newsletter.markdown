<span class="dropcap">I</span> have been thinking for long time in creating a newsletter. I made an [rss feed](/feed.xml) since day 1, but I know some people prefer newsletters.

So you can now sign-up to receive new posts on your inbox. No spam, just an email whenever a new blog post is published. And don't worry, you'll get 1 email per week at most.

<p align='center'>
 <a href="{{ site.newsletter }}" class='button'>Sign-up newsletter here!</a>

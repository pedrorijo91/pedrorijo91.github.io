<span class="dropcap">R</span>ecently [Google announced that it would shut down Google Code project](http://google-opensource.blogspot.pt/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html). The decision was somehow obvious if we look at the [current numbers for Github](https://github.com/about/press) or [the 2014 stats for Bitbucket](https://blog.bitbucket.org/2015/02/05/bitbucket-2014-in-review/).

Github has grown a lot in the last few years with the open source movement, reaching 9.2M users and 21.8M repositories. [GrowthHackers](https://growthhackers.com) provides a very interesting overview of [Githubs evolution over the years](https://growthhackers.com/companies/github/) where it is possible to see its exponential growth since 2008:

Between those almost 10M repositories there are a lot of interesting projects. Despite the fact that Github already provides a tool to explore great projects through [Github Trending](https://github.com/trending), there is another kind of repositories that should be shared, not because theirs tremendous usefulness, but because they make developers have a good time.
Today I wanna talk about some of those projects that I've found worthy:

### Telestrap
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) claims to be "the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web" and it's probably right. But don't you miss that old [Teletext](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletext) sometimes ?
Well, someone did miss it so much that decided to create a Bootstrap theme based on that, the [Telestrap](https://github.com/iamsteadman/telestrap/) !

Checkout some [examples](https://github.com/iamsteadman/telestrap/tree/master/examples):

<p align='center'><img src='/assets/img/telestrap_example_login.png' alt='Telestrap Login' title='Telestrap Login' width='600px'/></p>

<p align='center'><img src='/assets/img/telestrap_example_cover.png' alt='Telestrap Cover' title='Telestrap Cover' width='600px'/></p>

<p align='center'><img src='/assets/img/telestrap_example_dashboard.png' alt='Telestrap Dashboard' title='Telestrap Dashboard' width='600px'/></p>

### Emoji
Another funny project resulted in the [Emoji-Cheat-Sheet](https://github.com/arvida/emoji-cheat-sheet.com/), which lists the different emoji emoticons supported on several known services, such as [Github](https://github.com/) itself, [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/), and many others. It allows you to give some humor and express your emotions in commit messages for instance.

Not just for fun, Emoji found their place in some projects which decided to give useful meanings to emojis in commit messages. [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom) defines a set of rules for contributions, where [commit messages should contain emojis](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/97d697f1952eaa4bb0d5d71f4895877183ad53ba/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-messages) which would work as visual tags for each commit.

Gotta love them :heart_eyes:

### Julia
Have you ever heard about [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia), a new programming language? Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic language for technical computing. And some say it's pretty awesome, but will it ever be as awesome as [this pull request](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/8839) ? I think not...


### FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition
We all have worked before with one of those guys who simply loves to overkill in simple tasks. Why should someone use a dozen of frameworks for task that could be done with a small command line application? Even worst, many enterprise software solutions try to adopt high software quality standards and design principles, leading to non-sense implementations.

[FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition) is a open source project where everyone can implement more *'good software development practices'*.
Why shouldn't someone replace all numbers in the code by constants? Why shouldn't someone use a factory to get the objects? Or why shouldn't someone use a the adapter pattern to get the behaviour from different classes?

It seems to be no limit for good software development practices...

### illacceptanything
Another open source comedy project, [illacceptanything](https://github.com/illacceptanything/illacceptanything) relies on other contributors to create the most random project ever. Commit anything you want to the repository and observe a mixing of webs most funny gif's, videos, and etc.

<span class="dropcap">H</span>ey there,  
 and welcome to my new blog!  

It has been a while since I got this idea of creating a blog, a place where I could share my nerd stories, and it finally happened. :smiley:  
I'm gonna use this blog to communicate with the world and to let you know I am up to.

**And no, it's not an April fools joke!**

Hoping to keep you guys with me!

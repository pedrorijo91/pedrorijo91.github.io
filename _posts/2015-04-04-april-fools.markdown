<span class="dropcap">A</span>pril 1<sup>st</sup> is like Xmas for media and tech companies. Every year, companies rush to exhibit theirs most awesome products. A quick Google search reveals hundreds of those tech revolutions launched in this time of the year.

This year was no different. Despite the usual list of *fake* products, some companies as Google and Microsoft provided us the funniest surprises:

* Microsoft launched MS-DOS mobile version enabling you to travel back in time.
* [Google Maps](https://www.google.pt/maps) enabled the Pacman mode where you can play the classic game Pacman in everyday streets. Awesome!

But let's review some of the most hilarious products of the day:

#### Tinder for Uber (or Uber for Tinder)
A two in one, [Tinder for Uber](http://tinderforuber.com/) and [Uber for Tinder](http://uberfortinder.com/), used two of the most iconic apps nowadays to play with users. Can you imagine yourself flirting with your Uber driver?

#### CERN researchers confirm existence of the Force
This is probably my favorite, when [CERN confirmed the existence of the force](http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2015/04/cern-researchers-confirm-existence-force) in its website.
What if the force was real? What if you could be master Yoda?

#### Mirrored Google
Although not available anymore, Google provided a mirrored version of its search engine in an alternative link at [https://com.google](https://com.google), maintaining the tradition of  surprising its users.

#### Retro Gentoo
[Gentoo announced total website makeover ](https://www.gentoo.org/news/2015/03/31/website-update.html) with a retro style. Have you taken a look?

#### Google mail

It's impossible to find a group of developers where the at least one of them doesn't contain a [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) account (Apple and Microsoft employees not included). But what about the [mailbox of the future](http://googleblog.blogspot.pt/2015/03/smartbox-by-inbox-mailbox-of-tomorrow.html)? A physical mailbox with features like spam filters and smart folders, or mobile notifications.

#### Goodbye parentheses
When introduced to Lisp-family programming languages, it's pretty usual that new programmers start complaining about the syntax. And in facts it's very easy to end up closing several parentheses:

{% highlight clojure %}
(defun factorial (n)
  (if (<= n 1)
    1
    (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
{% endhighlight %}


 With that in mind, [Clochure](http://clochure.org/) was presented as an improved Clojure with a set of [great advantages](https://github.com/videlalvaro/clochure/#advantages).

#### Google, Google, and more Google
Google must be the most highlighted company in April fools. Besides already presented launchings, Google also gets referenced about [purchasing Dubai islands](http://inhabitat.com/google-purchases-dubais-world-of-islands-to-reconfigure-into-google-shaped-floating-cities/) just for creating an archipelago with Google logo design.

#### Samsung Galaxy Blade
Have you ever though on going to the Facebook when preparing the salad? With [Samsung Galaxy Blade](http://global.samsungtomorrow.com/galaxy-blade-edge-chefs-edition/) it could be possible, although I do not recommend to use sharp knifes when getting distracted by your friends on social networks...

#### And many others
Many other jokes gave me a good laugh. For instance, a [new compressing algorithm](https://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/ziprebel-download-the-internet-in-milliseconds/) that could compress any file to a single bit, enabling to download and store the full internet, in a single bit!
And have you ever thought the simple action of going to the bathroom could be the next social network? Well, someone did...
Or what about improving wireless reception [through the smell](http://www.wiffi.co.uk/)?

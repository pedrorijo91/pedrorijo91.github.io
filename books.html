			<div class="description">I started to read this book back on 2012/2013, but I never had the change to finish it. Although many of the concepts in the book were already introduced to me during my academic education, I want to give it a closer look this time.</div>

			<div><span class="title">Programming Language Pragmatics</span> <small class="read-date">(Currently reading)</small></div>
			<div class="description">A former teacher recommended me this book and told me that it covers a lot of areas related to programming languages, such as compilation and interpretation for instance. It seems to me that it may deep my knowledge in programming covering what's typically under the hood. I will make a review as soon as I finish reading it.</div>

			<div><span class="title"><a href="http://pedrorijo91.github.io/blog/seven-languages-seven-weeks/">Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</a></span> <small class="read-date">(2015)</small></div>
			<div class="description">A great book for getting an overlook in several languages and programming paradigms that will certainly make you want to learn something new.</div>

			<div><span class="title">Play for Scala</span> <small class="read-date">(2014)</small></div>
			<div class="description">Another book I decided to give a look in order to better understand the Scala world, this time focusing on the Play framework. Once again, a book that unfortunately got a bit deprecated by the time I decided to read it. Many functionalities and API were already deprecated, and some more recent where not approached yet.</div>

			<div><span class="title">Programming in Scala</span> <small class="read-date">(2014)</small></div>
			<div class="description">A book I decided to read to better understand Scala. Although the fact that's a good book it's a pity that it still uses Scala 2.8, while Scala 2.10 was the latest version by the time of reading (November 2014). Between several differences, in this book <a href="http://akka.io/">Akka</a> was not the default actor system in Scala yet.</div>
